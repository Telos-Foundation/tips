# Abstract

Determine that the Telos Blockchain Network, once launched shall activate based on the passage of time at a block height of 1,000,000 blocks rather than when it has received 15% of TLOS holders' votes.

# Motivation
The Telos Blockchain Network is approaching its first launch vote meeting and will soon consider launching and activating the network. It is necessary to clearly explain the procedure for launching and activating the Telos Blockchain Network. The process for activating the network using activation voting should be revised into a time-based activation because the rationale for EOS activation is inapplicable to Telos. Because this was explained differently in the Telos white paper, it is necessary to document this change here.

# Rationale 

The Telos white paper spoke of using 15% activation voting to determine when the network should activate, just as EOS did. EOS required this voting process because Block.One had sold EOS tokens in a public sale but removed themselves from the launch process. Therefore, to allow the EOS community to determine which of many potential EOS chains would be the most valid one, Block.One required a chain to receive 15% of votes from among all EOS genesis tokenholders. Ultimately, only one EOS chain launch attempt was made and the EOS network activated 4 days, 4 hours, and 41 minutes later. Telos has never sold any tokens and there is no danger of multiple potential Telos networks launching. The rationale for activation voting, therefore does not apply to Telos and only serves as an unnecessary and unfounded impediment. Exchanges, Dapps, and users can only begin using the network on activation and Dapp developers in particular have a strong preference for a firm date for activation.

# Specification 

It is proposed that Telos activate its network at block 1,000,000, 5.8 days after launch. This will give users ample time to begin voting for the block producers who will operate the network, while providing all other stakeholders a predictable date and time to commence operations and activity.
