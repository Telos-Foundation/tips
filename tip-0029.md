TIP 0029
Title:  Founder's Rewards Distribution Consideration
Authors: Azad Halim
Status: Draft
Type: Informational
Created: 2018-10-26
 

Abstract
---------

This TIP is dependent on the approval/passing of TIP 24.

This proposal is informational and will not require voting unless 
the Telos community deems it necessary following the increase of 
the rewards pool to 18 million tokens.

Motivation
-----------

Since its conception back in July 2018, the Telos project attracted a 
large number of contributors to Good Block's excellent initiative.

The approval of TIP 24 recognises this fact and aimes to reward those 
additional contributors for their hard work.

This proposal aims to extend the spirit of Telos' fair drop, that is 
being offered to the wider EOS community, to also apply here.

Rational
---------

The rational for creating Telos is to provide a second opportunity for 
the EOS community to participate more effectively and establish a wider 
circle of trust through fairer distribution.

I would like to draw attention of the community to some simple calculations 
of rewards while larger teams are considering the application of self imposed 
limits of their own.

Of the total estimated number of 300 million Telos tokens: 

- 75% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 4.5% of the total supply.
- 66% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 4.0% of the total supply.
- 50% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 3.0% of the total supply.
- 33% of 18 million tokens is equivalent to 2.0% of the total supply.
