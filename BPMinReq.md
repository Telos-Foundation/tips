# Telos Block Producer Minimum Requirements:
 
The intent of this document is to clarify the minimum requirements for Block Producer’s to participate in the Telos Blockchain Network (herein referred to as the “TBN”). There are multiple phases of participation, with each level having more stringent requirements than the previous - this is intended to address the growing requirements of the network over time.

The specifications stated herein are subject to revision, as well as when the network will move from stage to stage - as determined by a vote of  ⅔ + 1 of the current Block Producers at the time of the proposed revisions.

Regardless of their level of participation, to participate in the TBN at any phase - Block Producer candidates are required to provide, and abide by the following:

### A. Disclosures:

#### 1.  Block Producer Account Name

#### 2.  Block Producer Public Key

#### 3.  Block Producer Organization Info:

a. Candidate Name
          
b. Candidate Website URL
          
c. Candidate country of registration for registered entity or residence of primary owner if not a registered entity as 2-letter ISO country coded. 

d. Candidate server location(s)
         
i. Location name
                      
ii. Country as 2-letter country code
                      
iii. latitude
                      
iv. Longitude
                      
#### 4: Network Emergency Contact(s)

b. email address
          
c. phone number - in a non-public, password protected, repository commonly accessible to any of the 51 paid Block Producers and Standbys.

#### 5. Block Producer Entity Ownership

Disclosure of each beneficial owner of block producer entity along with percentage of ownership. [enforced by smart contract]

Disclosure of accepted third-party identification verification service and identification hash for each beneficial owner (* to be implemented).

### B. Practices:

1. Sync with an approved NTP server at least once per 24 hours.

2. Adoption of account blacklist maintained by the Elected Arbitrators.  

## Phase One - Minimum Requirements
