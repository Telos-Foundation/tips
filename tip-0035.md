# Abstract

This proposal is aimed to create a competitive environment for Telos Block Producers and also to encourage more proactive participation. In Telos Blockchain, we can have 51 BPs (21 Active BPs + 30 Standby BPs), and every month these BPs get TLOS tokens for producing the blocks. Since the launch of Telos Mainnet, we have seen a decrease in active participation of BPs and the total number of BPs competing for the 51 positions is almost the same as the availability of positions. The current model is not encouraging BPs to be more proactive and to hold their tokens instead it’s affecting the token price in a negative way. The proposal is to create a competitive environment by adding a minimum votes threshold requirement for a Block Producer to be eligible for rewards. The minimum votes threshold has to be modular and managed by the active BPs with a multi-sig action. This new addition can create more proactive participation from BPs due to its competitive nature and potentially encourage BPs to HODL their tokens.

# Motivation

We are in a critical phase currently which defines the success or failure of Telos Blockchain Network. In recent months, we have seen an increase in the flow of dApps joining Telos Blockchain Network and also increased participation from the community in regards to governance and token price. The proactive discussions and participation from community members encouraged the members to propose TEDP 2.0 which is focused on the long-term sustainability of Telos. As we are all working towards the long-term sustainability of Telos, we have to make some important changes to the way things work and encourage proactive participation from all the stakeholders in the Telos Blockchain ecosystem.

The motivation for this proposal is to encourage active participation from BPs and to create a competitive environment where all the value creators are incentivized fairly. 

# Rationale

We have minimum BP requirements in Telos today and we are at a critical phase that will determine the long-term success. There are two important rationales behind this proposal as listed below: 

**Creating a competitive environment:** The current model of encouraging BPs who only contribute infrastructure is not working and we need more proactive participation.

**Effect on Token Price:** Since the success of the TEDP 1.0 proposal, there is an increase in the effective tokens paid to ABPs and SBPs, the rationale at that time was the low token price but this has actually affected the token price in a negative way. Also, we are seeing an increased number of instances where new BP registers and starts collecting rewards to make a quick buck without actually contributing to the growth of the Telos ecosystem.

# Specification

Proposal: To have a minimum votes threshold for a BP to get paid, the threshold should be adjusted by the active BPs in accordance with the total staked TLOS.

The preliminary proposal for the threshold is to set at 25% of staked TLOS. This could be discussed and adjusted by the active BPs. This proposal will have an impact on the standby BPs who have votes less than the set threshold.

Upon the implementation of the threshold requirement, the bp pool fund will only draw funds needed to pay the bps who satisfy the requirements. This means that bps will not get any additional pay though there are less than 51BPs who satisfy the requirements.

### Actions to be taken

Identifying the votes threshold logic based on the staked TLOS. It should be configurable. Preliminary suggestion 25% of staked TLOS.
Update article-10 of TBNOA as follows:

“Block Producers are eligible for the pay when they meet a minimum votes threshold which is defined and adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote of the Block Producers, the threshold should be defined and adjusted in accordance with the total staked TLOS. Block Producer and Standby Block Producers shall be paid each day from a daily fund consisting of the daily share of 1% annual inflation (the "BP Inflation Rate") of the entire value of the Telos blockchain as measured in TLOS tokens. If there are less than 51BPs who satisfy the minimum votes threshold then the Block Producer payouts from the daily fund are calculated based on the number of eligible BPs. Every day, this total amount shall be allocated such that each Block Producer receives the same pay for the time spent as a Block Producer as every other Block Producer and each Standby receives pay that is half of the rate of each Block Producer for its time spent as a Standby, with the provision that Block Producers and Standby Block Producers may have their daily pay allotment deducted in proportion with the percentage of blocks they were expected to produce in their most recent production period of 180,000 blocks (approximately 24 hours) or fewer, but failed to produce. Loss of pay from failing to regularly execute the "claimrewards" action, shall be borne by the Block Producer or Standby Block Producer, not the network. For as long as funds exist in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund account named "exrsrv.tf", the aggregate amount of pay for all Block Producers and Standby Block Producers shall be drawn from that fund preferentially to creating new TLOS tokens to pay into the Block Producer pay account named "eosio.bpay" at a rate equivalent to 6.0% annual inflation through block 98,000,000; equivalent to 5.3% annual inflation for blocks 98,000,001 through block 113,000,000; equivalent to 3.4% annual inflation for blocks 113,000,001 through block 128,000,000; equivalent to 3.0% annual inflation from block 128,000,001. This rate may be adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote of the Block Producers provided it does not exceed the limits set in Clause 49 "Telos Economic Development".”

# Discussion

* Q: Who will be affected by this proposal?

    A: The block producers who don't meet the minimum votes threshold will be affected. So potentially this will have an impact on the new block producers and existing stanby BPs.
    
* Q: How will the threshold be determined?

    A: The threshold will be determined by the block producers with a multisig transaction.

* Q: What is the purpose or expected impact?

    A: Upon the acceptance of this proposal, we expect the newly joining BPs and the BPs in standby positions will reach out to the community campaigning for votes. This will encourage more proactive participation and serious BPs.

* Q: If there are less than 51 eligible BPs, will the block producers get paid more from the daily fund?

    A: No, the daily fund will be calculated based on the number of eligible block producers. So the rewards would still be the same as par the TEDP 2.0
