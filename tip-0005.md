# Abstract

This proposal outlines a plan to standardize Token Registries across the Telos Network, as well as define a common interface for inter-registry communication.

# Motivation

As the Telos Network grows, standardized communication interfaces will become necessary in order to allow token transactions between registries. Declaring a network-wide standard will allow any tokens developed on Telos to be reused by other applications.

# Rationale

In the Telos Network, a token or groups of tokens are collectively tracked and managed by a single contract, which will henceforth be known as a Token Registry. Due to the free nature of the network, anyone can write their own Token Registry, which will likely result in a multitude of different interfaces across the network that may or may not be able to communicate with each other.

# Specification

The TIP-5 Single Token Registry Standard defines an interface that allows for inter-registry communication and on-chain third-party support for token contracts that implement a single token. The interface is defined as follows:

### Tables

* `typedef account::multi_index< ... , ... > balances`

    The `balances` table will hold all accounts and their respective token balances. The table is indexed by `account_name`.

* `typedef account::multi-index< ... , ... , ... > allotments`

    The `allotments` table will hold all approved account allotments, indexed by the token owner's `account_name`.

### Fields

* `string token_name` --- OPTIONAL

* `asset max_supply`

* `asset supply`

### Functions

* `string get_name()` --- OPTIONAL

    Returns the full name of the token.

* `int64_t get_balance(account_name owner)`

    Returns the `asset.amount` associated with the `owner` account in the balances table.

* `symbol_type get_symbol()`

    Returns the `symbol_type` of the contract token.

* `int64_t get_supply()`

    Returns the `int64_t` value of the total circulating supply of the contract token.

* `int64_t get_max_supply()`

    Returns the `int64_t` value of the maximum supply of the contract token.

* `void mint(account_name recipient, asset tokens, string memo)`

    Mints new tokens into the circulating supply.

* `void transfer(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens, string memo)`

    Executes an action to transfer `tokens.amount` quantity of tokens from the `owner` account to the `recipient` account with the `memo` as a brief human-readable explanation detailing the reason for the transfer.

* `bool approve(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Allows `recipient` to withdraw from the `owner` account, multiple times, up to the value of `tokens.amount`. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allotment with `tokens.amount`.

* `int64_t allotment(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Returns the amount of `owner`'s tokens that have been made spendable by the approved `recipient` account.

* `bool transfer_from(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Sends the quantity of tokens in `tokens.amount` from the `owner` account to the `recipient` account, up to the amount defined by the `owner`'s call to the `approve()` action.

* `void sub_balance(account_name owner, asset tokens)`

    Safely subtracts the `tokens.amount` balance from `owner`'s account.

* `void add_balance(account_name owner, asset tokens, account_name payer)`

    Safely adds the `tokens.amount` balance to `owner`'s account. Charges `payer` with resource consumption.

As stated in TIP-3 Option A, the eosio.token contract will be modified to serve as a Master Registry that maintains a running table of all other Token Registries. By calling `register_token()` on the Master Registry contract, the calling account registers an independently written Single Token Registry. Registering an independent contract in this way will add the contract information to a table managed by the Master Registry.

* `register_token(account_name contract, asset token, string url)`

    The `register_token()` function is called by an independent contract to register their token with the Master Registry.

# Discussion

* Who pays for the resources consumed by calling these actions?
    
    Suggestion: The account that pays for the ram consumption is context dependent. For example, `owner` provides the ram when calling `approve()`.

* Does this interface only work for single token contracts?

    Answer: Yes. A forthcoming Multi Token Registry Standard will declare an interface for interacting with contracts that implement 1 or more tokens on a single contract.

# Summary for Shareholders

The changes suggested in this TIP will declare a standard for developing token contracts. All future token contracts adhering to this standard will be able to communicate and transfer assets amongst one another. This will also pave the way for contract integration with exchanges and other third-party developers.
