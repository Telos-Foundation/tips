# Abstract

This proposal aims at addressing the Telos Founders Rewards Pool (TFRP) funds and their distribution in a fair way to the serious contributors. The TFRP funds of 6 MM TLOS is to be distributed among Telos Contributors team members for the purpose of incentivizing the contributions made to Telos network pre-launch. Contributions include and not limited to opt-ins before public announcement by BPs, time spent working on tasks[development, testing, marketing, administrative etc,.] before and after working groups, or supporting financially in a manner that contributes to a successful Telos launch. To keep things simple this proposal divides the contributions into two categories Core & Abstract layers. A further sub-category division is inevitable and a slicing pie mechanism can be implemented.

# Motivation

This proposal aims to create incentive structures for those risking time and money to lay the groundwork to launch the Telos network. Creating incentives for initial contributors will increase the chances for success of the Telos project as a whole. The proposed method is based on categorizing contributions into Core and Abstract layers. In a further stage a “Slicing Pie” model can be used to dynamically split so everyone gets what they deserve.

What belongs to Core Category?

All contributions which stands as a basis for Telos to exist belongs to this category. Some contributions include and are not limited to Code-base development, Idea & Whitepaper proposal by GoodBlock, Opt-ins by some BPs before public announcement, Security testing, Exchange-outreach. The contributions made in previously mentioned tasks are valuable and they stand as the basis for Telos Network.

What belongs to Abstract Category?

All other contributions apart from Core but are important for Telos growth belongs to this category. Some contributions include and are not limited to working on tasks in working groups related to bounty-system, community rewards pool, dapps-outreach, project-management, administration, governance, on-boarding, social-media, education. The tasks in these working groups are still important for the growth of the Telos network and are considered to be valuable.

# Rationale

This bounty system proposal design is based on Categorizing and the Slicing Pie methodology which can be summarized as a framework for objectively measuring a fair split given a group of contributors that are all risking varying amounts of time and/or cash. This proposal does not aim to undermine anyones contribution, the goal is to achieve a a fair compensation mechanism where each contributors get what they deserve:

% share of the reward = % share of what’s at risk[Contributions + Category]

To Categorize and give a numerical value for various contributions the below multipliers are presented:

1) If the contribution belongs to a category - Core: Multiplier = 2. Which means a contributor gets 2 times the Average adjusted FMV of all contributors.

2) If the contribution belongs to a category - Abstract: Multiplier = 1. Which means a contributor gets the Average adjusted FMV of all contributors.

# Each contributor’s split is calculated as follows:

If the contributions belong to Core category:

    Contributor FMV = 2 * The Average Adjusted FMV of all contributors

If the contributions belong to Core category:

    Contributor FMV = The Average Adjusted FMV of all contributors

Contributor split % of the TFRP = [Contributor FMV * Hours Contributed / The Agrregated or Total FMV of all contributors]

As the Telos token doesn't hold any fiat value today it's hard to estimate a FMV for each individual contributions. So the Average adjusted FMV is calculated by collecting self-reported FMVs/hour from all the contributors and then find an Average Adjusted FMV. 

In order to make things simpler the contributors have to come up with a FMV which they think is fair for their contributions per hour. The concept of “slices” is used to measure the adjusted Fair Market Value of each contribution. Normalizing hourly rates and cash spend to be denominated in USD and agreeing on an average FMV, we can create an accounting system for quantitatively assigning a number of slices to each contribution and thus an objective measure for value. The more slices you earn prior to the TFRP distribution, the higher your percentage of the TFRP split.

# Specification

This design proposes a system for identifying the Fair market value and tracking self-reported contributions. The contributors in each working group should use Trello to document the tasks and also to report hours spent using "Time Tracking". The reported times can be audited by other group members or chairs using the "Time Camp" Dashboard or from audit reports. If any issues or inconsistencies, anyone in the group can raise an issue and the disputes are settled manually via majority vote of the named chairs or between the plaintiff and defendant. 


### Time Reporting

Honesty is the best policy!!!

Time tracking is now integrated to Trello and a contributor can use it to report his contributions. 

# Compensating The Telos Founders, the Opt-in BPs before Public announcement, individuals & groups who contributed before introducing working groups.

It has always been a gray area of how to compensate the individuals and founders who have been here from the beginning and contributed before the introduction of working groups. This proposal tries to address this by considering their work to be under "Core Category".

The awesome work done by Douglas and Goodblock team is the core reason we are working on Telos right now. So it's fair to compensate them with some extra incentive as they are the pioneers. We can compensate them in one of the ways suggested below:

    1) By allocating a fixed fund of 0.5 million tokens to the GoodBlock team as an extra incentive for coming up with Telos.
    2) By giving them a multiplier of '3' for the hours they have spent before the public announcement.

When it comes to Opt-in BPs or supporting partners before Public Announcement:

Though the BPs and partners haven't done most of the pre-work. But showing their support and coming out to be part of this project from the beginning is worth something. We can compensate them by a fixed fund as below:

    * A total of 40000 tokens to be allocated to each of the founding partner or BPs.

When it comes to the work done before the introduction of working groups and project management tools:

Many individuals and teams have been contributing to make Telos network a great succecc. To fairly compensate their work:

    1) Each individual or team is required to create corresponding Trello cards for their work.
    2) Write information, details and accomplishments about the task.
    3) Log how many hours spent.

The above proposal to compensate are open for discussion.


# Open Questions

1. When should the TFRP be distributed?
Suggestion: After the Telos network activates.
